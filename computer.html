    <h1>How to Build A PC</h1>

    <h2>CPU</h2>
    <p>CPU is the central procesing unit. its the brain of the computer... blah blah blah im sure youve heard this before. The two most common manufacturers are AMD and Intel but basically, more gigafarts equals faster PC. Dont forget a CPU cooler for it bc things get toasty.(Yes its possible to cook food on a hot CPU but its not recommended.)</p>


    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    
    <h2>RAM</h2>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <img src="media/disks.jpg" alt="psu">
    <p>There are to types of storage dives, solid state drives and hard disk drives. Hard drives contain spinning magnetic disks that contain all the 1s and 0s of the data stored on them. They are significantly slower than solid state drives</p>

    <h2>PSU</h2>
    <img src="media/psu.jpg" alt="psu">
    <p>The power supply unit delivers power to the motherboard, CPU, and sata drives. Most desktop PSUs are an ATX form factor whcih is the standard. The wattage of a power supply determines how muhc power can be supplied. Higher end systems require a higher wattage and as a result, cost more. They have various efficiency ratings ranging from bronze to platinum. The higher the rating, the less energy is lost when converting from ac to dc. </p>

    <h3>once you have all the components just connect them together(they should connect like legos)</h3>

    <p>yeah you could put these components in a case but they will still work without a case just throw them in a cardboard box or something.</p>
