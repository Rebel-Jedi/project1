    <h3>3D Modeling</h3>
    <p>Before printing anything you need to have a digital model of what you are trying to print. There are various 3D model file types but the most common types are obj and stl</p>
    <p>Many people download these models for free from the internet. It is possible to design your own 3D Models using popular 3D modeling software such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>TinkerCAD</li>
      <li>OnShape</li>
      <li>SolidWorks</li>
      <li>Autodesk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>TinkerCAD or Fusion 360. TinkerCAD is very beginner friendly and it allows you to combine basic shapes. software such as Autodesk is designed for engineers and professionals creating intricate models. Programs like these take a lot of time and effort to master and often cost a lot of money. After designing something with CAD software, you must save your model as one of the previously mentioned file types. This file is then used in the slicer</p>
